I'm fairly proud of my Japanese abilities. I've been told a few times that I remember the most random words, which usually makes me quite proud. Today I was thinking about one of the worst things that ever happened to me. I'm going to tell you about one of the worst things that ever happened to me, and how it relates to how I learn words.

When my wife and I moved to Germany, we were hit with a double-whammy: we were scammed out of most of our money with an AirBnB clone, and then we had all of our cash, and my most important belongings, stolen from us at the airport when we arrived. On the one hand I feel silly having been so crushed by losing my things, but on the other hand that bag had everything inanimate object that made me happy:

* A really good book I was only partway through that a friend got me as a birthday present
* My iPad 1, which was hopelessly out of date in 2016 but was still perfect for reading PDFs and kindle books
* My personal laptop
* My headphones
* My electronic dictionary
* My only supply of hard plastic sleeves that I use for carrying around words to be studied. They only sell these at The Daiso.

All of that was a huge loss, but the electronic dictionary was the worst. It was a [Casio Ex-Word GW9600](http://gakuran.com/casio-ex-word-xd-gw9600/), the best model available to purchase in 2007. It cost me close to $500 of hard-earned cash (I basically bought it as a kid). It had a huge word inventory, and opened up an enormous world to me. Let me tell you: if you buy an electronic dictionary, you should pay enough to get the one with the most words. It happened on a regular basis that one missionary would look up a word in their dictionary, wouldn't find it, and I would find it in mine. It's worth the money.

It was a constant companion in the missionary training center, and then during my entire mission in Chuugoku and on Shikoku. I had it out for every conversation, which might have been annoying to others, honestly, but it was so fast that it only took 5-10 seconds to check a word. It was there for every moment, joyful or painful, that I had as a missionary. I lost my bag with it inside once and someone was kind enough to take it to the police station for me! It had a piano-keyboard charm on it that I got at an orchestra concert of a church member's son. They raffled off chances to conduct the orchestra for a piece, and it was so much fun! When I visited a year later, the man was delighted to see that I carried the charm everywhere.

After a while I realized that the protective case was a waste of time, since the body was so robust anyway, and I got rid of it. The paint cracked here and there, and the edges became worn. I could recognize my machine anywhere. I finished my mission and carried the dictionary with me at all times in college, too. I hadn't realized before how often I heard words in my native language that I didn't know, or only vaguely understood (and often misunderstood!). I always had it out in classes, and I even took it to church in case a speaker used a new word. It was always there in my cargo shorts pocket. Who needs a cell-phone if you have a dictionary already? I didn't even carry my wallet that often. And I still had it with me 10 years after purchase when I was living in Japan again with my wife.

***

And now it's gone. Eventually I saved enough money to buy another one, shipped here from Japan, but it's not the same. It doesn't have my wear and tear, my piano charm, or my data.

And the data was very important. The device saves your search history and also allows you to save words in a tango-cho, and my tango-cho was filled to capacity (1200 words).

And this is where much of the loss lies. Whenever I looked up a word I didn't know, I saved it in the internal tango-cho. These were stored in a simple list that I could review by scrolling through it. And this was how I would review: if I had a 1-hour train ride, I would scroll through the words, ask myself if I knew the word, and if I did then I would delete it. Pretty basic compared to something like Anki, but it got the job done. The best thing about this method, in my experience, is how easy is to identify the context where a word was added. For example, if I spent an afternoon with my wife at Book Off searching for books on Japanese Sign Language, I would likely be able to recognize the list of words that I saved during that afternoon perusal, even years later.

This effectively turns a tango-cho into a journal for me. Each entry is associated with a personal experience, and when I delete the word I continue to remember the experience. Many of the words from my mission bring me delight, or sadness, or anger, and I will remember them forever because I will remember what me feel delighted, saddened, or angry forever.

Some fun examples:

* ドンパチ
* ありがとうございました
* 落札
* 腰痛
* 哲学者

From other languages:

* 我餓死了
* cộng sản
* zwei Dumme, eine Gedanke
* Кафе с мляко
* eodiroga?
* mapakla
* สถานีต่อไป

Every one of these memories has people, places, circumstances of my life now long past.
