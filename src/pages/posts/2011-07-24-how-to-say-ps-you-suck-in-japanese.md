title: How to say "P.S. You Suck" in Japanese
---

This post will focus on two very interesting vocabulary items in Japanese; I call them "p.s. you suck" suffixes, though I'm sure there is a better word to describe them.

Adding a め to a noun insults the noun it is suffixed to:

* 馬鹿め！["baka-me", idiot!]
* この小娘め！["kono komusume-me!", stupid girl!]
* 太郎め！ ["Tarou-me!", dang Tarou!]

The verb  ["yagaru"] attaches to the base II or connective form of verbs and adds the same feeling as the め suffix:

* 覚えてやがれ！["oboeteyagare!", remember this you fool!]
* 罠にかかりやがって... ["wana ni kakariyagatte...", getting caught in a trap, you're so stupid.]
* 何を言いやがるんだ！ ["nani o iiyagarunda!", what the heck are you saying?!]

Both of these forms are used when yelling at or cursing some entity.

I personally don't use them a lot, but they are very common in anime, probably because of the dramatic nature. [Here's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWKg_E3mWsw) an example for やがる. It's the last word the villain says (besides キラーン, a sparkly sound akin to "bwing" or "bling"). Note that the subtitle should be "Remember this!", not "I'll remember this!".
