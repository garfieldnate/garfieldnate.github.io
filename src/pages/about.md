I'm Nate Glenn. I'm also known as garfieldnate on [GitHub](https://github.com/garfieldnate) or nglenn on [CPAN](https://metacpan.org/author/NGLENN). I live in Germany and work as a software engineer.

Although this blog contains mostly programming-related articles, my interests vary and I may also write about:

- linguistics
- Japanese or other East/Southeast Asian languages
- Chinese characters
- productivity
- games
- life as an ex-pat
- books

My old blog was called [Guren Linguistics](http://gurenlinguistics.blogspot.com/). I don't seem to be very good with titles...
