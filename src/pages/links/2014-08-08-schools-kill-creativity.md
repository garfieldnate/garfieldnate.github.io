### [Ken Robinson Says Schools Kill Creativity](http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity)

First post of my new linklog; I'll be writing responses to articles from BYU's [CS 404](http://students.cs.byu.edu/~knutson/cs404).

There's another reason schools kill creativity in my opinion: by killing intrinsic motivation. The worst culprit is literature class. I did honors/AP all through high school, and haven't read a classic since (except Ender's Game, which is a rather new classic). Who wants to read anything when it's just required reading to make the grade? Kids should learn to enjoy good works of mankind because they are enriching, instead of just developing an aversion to requirements of "the system". [Sudbury Schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudbury_school) look nice. No classes!
